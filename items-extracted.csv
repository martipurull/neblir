If you have not been trained specifically, you must  immediately cease experimentation. Danger of death. Danger of severe mental impairment. Even if qualified directly under Dr Syna Urv, never, under any circumstances, should the user operate the Quantum Oracle alone.”

Your vision blurs, then fades to black. You lose all sensation. Nothing hurts. You don’t feel anything. Perhaps because nothing is. But you are. You are nothing and everything that is possible at the same time. You exist, you are aware of your existence, but it’s like your consciousness has been disconnected and floats in a sea of where the known and the unknown coalesce with the possible and the impossible. Everything is dark, everything is silent, everything is before you and nothing is. And then a voice or is it text or is it a thought…
“Congratulations, you have connected to a different version of you. You are not quite here nor there, not quite now nor then. This is your quantum self.
Using this heightened state of being, you can send a question into the future, to be answered by you, a future you, one that may know the answer.
You must understand this poses a high risk to your mental wellbeing. Consider how you think you would react when asked a certain question. Consider you may receive no answer; this could be because you can’t or won’t answer, or because you no longer exist in the time you have set the question to be asked at.
Thus, before proceeding, some advice:
Limit the complexity of your questions and narrow it down as much as possible; thus, multiple-answer questions are preferable to open questions but less so than binary questions.
Limit the time frame: after all, you are more likely to be alive in an hour than ten years from now.
Finally, avoid paradoxical questions, such as ‘What am I going to ask next?’ These have proven particularly lethal in previous tests due to their propensity to cause quantum loops, which are particularly difficult to disconnect from.
Once you have worded your question, you must think of asking it. The Quantum Oracle will let you know it has been asked.
If you do not wish to proceed, you must think of disconnection. Remember, those outside cannot interact with you right now, for you are in a state too complex to be constrained by time and space.
You can think of disconnecting at any moment, but it is best practice to wait for an answer if a question has already been asked. Otherwise, you may continue to ask questions, but please remember the risks stated.
Congratulations once again. You have become your very own Quantum Oracle.”
One Action to disconnect: roll Mentality + GRID + GRID Mod (2 Successes needed); on a failure, take 1d6 Mental damage (2d6 if disconnecting before waiting for an answer). You can try again or continue asking questions.

One Reaction to use a charge and activate it (the effect lasts until the end of the user’s next turn). It offers a glimpse into seconds into the future.

For instance, if an enemy approaches the character wearing the activated ChronoBlink and makes a Melee Attack, the wearer can negate that by saying they moved elsewhere before. If an enemy Attacks an ally, the wearer can use a Reaction and charge to jump Initiative and shoot the enemy before that happens.
Additionally, while the ChronoBlink is active, the user adds 4d10 to both Attack and Defence rolls as they anticipate enemies’ movements, and while active, the wearer does not incur Attacks of Opportunity.
Finally, the wearer can use a charge to decide where in the Initiative order they want to be placed after rolling Initiative. This use doesn’t cost a Reaction as it is part of the Initiative roll (reaction).",,,,,,,,,,

Sonny Page’s Special Explosive (full),WEAPON,,,,"After being underwhelmed by the explosive he used at Pampers, Sonny Page went back to his garage and added a higher charge to his other prototype. This version, however, is unstable: shooting it will detonate it and sudden movements have a chance of making it explode too.
This explosive is unstable:
When turning it on and connecting to it, there is a 1% chance it will explode. Roll 1d100 when turning it on: on a 1, it detonates. Roll 1d100 when connecting to it via GRID: on a 1 or 2, it detonates.
When triggering it manually within 100 metres via GRID, the explosive has a 95% chance of detonating. Roll 1d100: on a 1 to 5 result, it fails to detonate, but might detonate at any moment.
The timer seems to work 80% of the time. Roll 1d100 when it counts to zero: on a 1 to 20 result, it fails to detonate, but might detonate at any moment.
The laser trigger is also faulty, having a 75% chance of detonating when someone interferes with the laser field. Roll 1d100 when someone enters the laser radius: on a 1 to 25 result, it fails to detonate, but might detonate at any moment.",,"The explosive has an on/off button. Turning it on allows the user to connect to it via GRID and set a trigger, either time or laser. The laser is invisible and has a radius of 50 metres.

It must be in contact with Kinian skin for it to have the desired effect.
If the Kinian wearing the amulet drops to 0 HP, they don’t do death saves. They are unconscious but stable.
If the Siike energy in the amulet has been “tied” to the blood of the Kinian individual in particular, upon dropping to 0HP, the wearer bounces back to consciousness, restoring 1d6 Physical HP per character level.
The amulet only works once. Once used, it is partially broken and charred.",,,,,,,,,,
